# QtGraphicalEffects

**The QtGraphicalEffects module has been deprecated and is no longer part of Qt.**

The functionality of the module has been partially incorporated into the Qt5Compat module.

The documentation for those parts can be found at
[Qt 5 Compatibility APIs: Graphical Effects](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtgraphicaleffects5-index.html)

## Working on Qt 5

To work on patches for the Qt 5 series, check out a local branch of the relevant Qt version, e.g.:

```bash
$ git checkout 5.15
Branch '5.15' set up to track remote branch '5.15' from 'origin' by rebasing.
Switched to a new branch '5.15'
```

## Going back in time

To inspect the code in the `dev` branch prior to its removal, follow these steps:

```bash
$ git checkout -b my-dev dev~1
Switched to a new branch 'my-dev'
```
